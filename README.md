# ðŸ”— Ketmanto Wangsa's Page
This page is created using [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink).
Feel free to connect with me and have a look at my academic publications on Linkedin. 

I include dark/light mode here.

For social media, I only include: 
1. Linkedin
2. Github
3. Twitter
4. Mastodon
5. Instagram
6. Mail 

LittleLink is a lightweight DIY alternative to services like [Linktree](https://linktr.ee)
and [many.link](https://many.link/). LittleLink was built using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), a dead simple, responsive boilerplate. 
I made some changes so some additional codes would be stripped.  ðŸ˜Š
